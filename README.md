# Rogue Customs

Welcome to Rogue Customs, the roguelike where YOU make the dungeon!

The gameplay itself might be extremely simplistic, but the appeal is that you don't have to beat a certain kind of dungeon with the same enemies and items. Instead, you are the one to define it. Do you want to go past a temple full of mystics? Sure. Do you want to get past an underground mafia facility? Go ahead! Your imagination's the limit (as well as the engine's limitations)!

## Do you just want to play a Dungeon?

Get the game in either of these sites:
 - The Releases section here.
 - https://supersnivy.itch.io/rogue-customs
 - https://gamejolt.com/games/RogueCustoms/813156

Then, go [Here][howtoplay] to know how to play the game.

## Do you want to make a Dungeon?

Well, I'm glad that you are interested in increasing this game's Dungeon pool. After all, that's what the game's made for! You can find information on the matter [Here][howtomakeadungeon].
